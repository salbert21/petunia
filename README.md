## petunia

Simulates planetary entry spacecraft dynamics.

**Note:** this GitHub repo contains none of the data required to actually run the program, because it tends to be too large to host here. If you are not me and you want to run the program, contact me : samuel.albert "at" colorado.edu

Current capacilities/notes:
- 3 DOF EOMs
- analysis tools for individual and batch simulation runs
- inertial and planet-relative vector or angluar i/o tools
- uses tabular atmosphere
- assumes any atmospheric rotation is captured in winds input
- currently no winds modeled
