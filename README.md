## petunia

Simulates planetary entry spacecraft dynamics.

**Note:** this GitHub repo contains none of the data required to actually run the program, because it tends to be too large to host here. If you are not me and you want to run the program, contact me : samuel.albert "at" colorado.edu

Current capacilities/notes:
- 3 DOF EOMs
- uses tabular atmosphere
- assumes any atmospheric rotation is captured in winds input
- currently no winds modeled
- currently very limited input/output types, just inertial vectors
